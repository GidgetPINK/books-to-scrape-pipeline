I just completed a web scraping project on Books to Scrape. After collecting and cleaning 1,000+ book entries, I found that Romance titles average $33.93 (3.25% cheaper than the site-wide average), price and rating are essentially uncorrelated (r ≈ 0.05), and nearly half of lower-rated books are also cheaper. Lesson learned: scraping is only the first step — turning messy HTML into insights is where the value lies.
